# Synxty

Welcome to the strategic world of **Synxty**, a captivating 2-player board and card game. Assemble and manage a squad of 8 unique legends, each wielding distinct powers and abilities to skillfully maneuver them through the battlefield and defeat your opponent in a tactical showdown.

The game unfolds in three dynamic phases per round: **Selection**, **Planning**, and **Battle**, wherein players take actions simultaneously. Consider **Legends'** combat attributes, abilities, roles, types, origins, and souls when making decisions and devising strategies to defeat all of your opponent's **Legends** and claim victory.

Are you ready for the ultimate test of strategy and wit? Sync and unite to conquer!

## 1. Overview

**Synxty** is a 2-player board and card game played on a grid-based battlefield, where each player strategically maneuvers a squad of 5 legends with an additional 3 on the bench ready for tactical swaps.

We'll now explore the game's core mechanics, delving into the intricacies of gameplay and the strategic nuances that shape the battlefield. From squad assembly to legends' abilities, energy management, and the three phases of each round, this section will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the game's mechanics.

### 1.1. Legends

Each legend has three unique abilities that require energy to cast: a **Basic**, a **Special**, and an **Ultimate**. The amount of energy needed to cast an ability is not fixed and can vary. Every legend is unique, with different **Attributes**, **Roles**, **Types**, **Origins**, and **Souls**, which influence their battlefield performance and strategic value.

### 1.2. Squad Assembly

Before entering the battlefield, each player assembles a squad of 8 legends, 5 starters and 3 substitutes. The game starts with the 5 starting legends already placed on the board while the remaining 3 substitutes stand ready on the bench.

### 1.3. Ability Decks

Both players have 3 decks of cards, one for each type of ability: **Basic Deck**, **Special Deck**, and **Ultimate Deck**. Each card represents a legend's ability and is associated with a specific legend. To kick off the game, all decks are shuffled and players draw one card from each of them.

### 1.4. Rounds

Rather than traditional turns, players engage in simultaneous gameplay, where each round consists of three phases: **Selection**, **Planning**, and **Battle**.

At the beginning of every round, all players must have 2 cards from each ability in their hand. If a player finds themselves with less than 2 cards for any ability, they draw from the respective deck until the requirement is met. This means that in the first round after the game is set up, both players will draw one card from each deck before the **Selection Phase** starts.

At the end of every round, all cards played are returned to the bottom of their respective decks, unless the represented ability was not cast. In such cases, the card is instead returned to the player's hand.

#### 1.4.1. Selection Phase

In the **Selection Phase**, players choose 3 cards from their hand, one for each type of ability, and lock them in for the **Planning Phase**. Simultaneously, players have the chance to swap legends from the bench with those on the board. This phase concludes when both players have locked their cards and selected their legends.

To maintain fairness, this phase is timed, and both legends and cards remain hidden from the opponent until it concludes.

#### 1.4.2. Planning Phase

During the **Planning Phase**, the legends selected in the previous phase are revealed, and players can strategically move them on their side of the board. Players can also select the cards to be played and their cast order, always considering their energy cost. This phase concludes when both players have locked in their legends positions and cards choices.

To maintain fairness, this phase is timed, and cards remain hidden from the opponent until it concludes.

#### 1.4.3. Battle Phase

In the **Battle Phase**, the battlefield ignites with combat as legends unleash their abilities. The order in which the abilities are cast is determined by the **Speed** of the legends to cast them. The legend with the highest **Speed** casts their abilities first, followed by the legend with the second-highest **Speed**, and so on. There are some nuances to this:

- When legends of the same team share identical **Speed**, the order is determined by the cards' cast order selected in the previous phase.
- For legends set to cast more than one ability, the order is determined by the cards' cast order selected in the previous phase.
- If a legend has the same **Speed** as an enemy legend the cast order is randomly determined.

While abilities are being cast, player's energy bars are updated accordingly. As there can be energy manipulation from the abilities, it's not guaranteed that all abilities will be cast. If a player doesn't have enough energy to cast an ability, that ability is skipped.

This phase concludes when all legends have cast their abilities.

### 1.5. Endgame

After the **Battle Phase** concludes, defeated legends are removed from the board and sent to the graveyard. A legend is declared defeated when their **Health** reaches 0.

The game ends when one of the players has no legends remaining on the board or on the bench. The player with at least one legend remaining is declared the winner.

## 2. Character Classes

In the world of **Synxty**, **Legends** stand as the playable combatants in this captivating strategic game. Alongside Legends, we'll introduce two other character classes: **Prospects** and **Masters**. Even though they are not playable, they play a pivotal role in the game's lore and the **Legends**' development.

### 2.1. Legends

As mentioned before, **Legends** take center stage as the playable characters on the battlefield. With their abilities and attributes, they are the driving force behind every victory.

### 2.2. Prospects

**Prospects** represent the promising future of battles in **Synxty**. These characters are the next generation of **Legends** in the making. To achieve this status, **Prospects** must undergo rigorous training at one of the **Houses of Mastery**, as we'll explore in detail later. Once a **Prospect** has completed their training and been deemed ready by their **House of Mastery**, they enter a pivotal phase as they become eligible for the **Draft**, where teams could select them to join their squad.

### 2.3. Masters

**Masters** in **Synxty** are the seasoned mentors and experts in the world of combat. They hold a unique position, as many of them are former **Legends** who have transitioned from the battlefield to a role of guidance and knowledge-sharing. These experienced individuals play a pivotal role in shaping the future of combatants, imparting their wisdom and honed skills to the current and the next generation.

However, this mastery of offense comes at a cost. Assassins tend to be relatively fragile, with lower **Health** and **Resistance** compared to other roles. Their survival depends on remaining hidden and avoiding direct confrontations whenever possible. Without adequate protection or support, they can easily succumb to enemy attacks.

To fully harness the power of Assassins, one must ensure their safety and provide opportunities for them to exploit enemy vulnerabilities. Properly utilized, Assassins can turn the tide of battle, becoming the bane of high-value targets and a crucial asset in achieving victory.

When characters are placed next to each other, the respective tiles connect, removing the gap between them and activating adjacency effects.

Each player starts the game with 3 rows of tiles under their control, the **Vanguard Line**, the **Mid Line**, and the **Rear Line**. The **Vanguard Line** is the row closest to the opponent's controlled area followed by the **Mid Line** and the **Rear Line**. It's important to name the rows as each row has its own set of adjacency effects.

## 6. Effects

This section delves into the intricate web of effects that shape the game's dynamic battles. From character-specific alterations to global battlefield transformations and the strategic nuances brought by character positioning, effects play a pivotal role in determining victory or defeat.

One distinctive feature of battlefield effects is their ability to trigger character effects, further intensifying the tactical depth of the game.

A tile is considered adjacent to another tile if they are connected through their sides, not their vertices.

These effects vary based on the row where the character is positioned, adding depth to players' decision-making, as they strive to maximize their characters' potential by optimizing their positions on the battlefield. While these effects are initially set, character abilities can alter them, creating opportunities for players to fine-tune their strategies.

#### 6.3.2. Adjacency Rear Frontier Effects
