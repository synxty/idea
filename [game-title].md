Step into the strategic world of [game-title], a 2-player board and card game where you command a squad of 5 characters, each with unique powers and abilities. Engage in simultaneous gameplay across three phases per round: selection, planning, and battle. Assemble your squad wisely from a roster of characters, considering roles, types, origins, and souls to surprise your opponent. Victory awaits the mastermind who outmaneuvers and outwits their rival by eliminating all of their opponent's characters!

## 1. Game Overview

[game-title] is a 2-player board and card game played on a 3 by 6 grid-based battlefield, where each player strategically maneuvers a squad of 5 characters.

Each character has three unique abilities that require energy to cast: a basic, a special, and an ultimate. The amount of energy needed to cast an ability is not fixed and can vary. These abilities are represented by cards that are shuffled and drawn from 3 separate decks, one for each type of ability.

At the beginning of the game, both players draw 2 cards from each deck, and their energy bars are fully charged.

Rather than traditional turns, players engage in simultaneous gameplay, where each round consists of three phases:

- **Selection Phase:** In this phase, players select 3 cards from their hand, one for each type of ability, and lock them in for the Planing Phase.
- **Planing Phase:** During this phase, players can strategically move their characters on the board and choose the ability cards as well as their cast order for the Battle Phase.
- **Battle Phase:** In this final phase, combat unfolds, abilities are casted, and the round's outcome is determined.

At the end of each round, the cards played are returned to the bottom of the respective deck, and each player draws the same amount of cards they used in the previous round so a new one can start.

The game concludes when one of the players has no characters remaining on the board.

Before the game, players must assemble a squad of 5 characters available on their team's roster. Each team has a roster of 12 characters, 2 for each character role. Since there are 6 different roles and only 5 squad spots available, players must carefully consider their options and select the best combination of characters to achieve victory. Squads can be built with any combination of roles and it's not required that they differ.

Besides roles, players also have to keep in mind a character's type, origin, and soul as these traits can be used to counter the opposition.

These cunning operatives excel at pinpointing high-priority targets, often positioned in the enemy's back line. With unparalleled precision and the ability to deliver astonishing bursts of damage, Assassins specialize in eliminating key threats to your team's success.

Their combat strategy revolves around stealth, speed, and ruthlessness. Assassins are masters of subterfuge, slipping past defenses to strike precisely where it hurts the most. Their attacks are calculated to eliminate opponents swiftly, disrupting enemy formations and creating opportunities for their comrades.

However, this mastery of offense comes at a cost. Assassins tend to be relatively fragile, with lower health and defenses compared to other roles. Their survival depends on remaining hidden and avoiding direct confrontations whenever possible. Without adequate protection or support, they can easily succumb to enemy counterattacks.

To fully harness the power of Assassins, strategic commanders must ensure their safety and provide opportunities for them to exploit enemy vulnerabilities. Properly utilized, Assassins can turn the tide of battle, becoming the bane of high-value targets and a crucial asset in achieving victory.

Typically positioned at the rear of the battlefield, Healers prioritize the well-being of their team above all else. With a focus on healing and assistance, their actions are guided by the singular aim of ensuring their companions' survival and success.

While Healers possess remarkable restorative abilities, they are often vulnerable themselves. Their relatively low health and frail constitution make them prime targets for enemy assaults. Without adequate protection, they may fall swiftly, leaving your team in a precarious position.

Rangers stand as the vanguard of your team's offensive might, serving as the paramount source of unrelenting damage. These nimble marksmen specialize in the art of delivering precision strikes from afar, inflicting devastating harm upon their targets. In fact, the farther they position themselves from the heat of battle, the more potent their attacks become, making them formidable damage dealers with a propensity for long-range engagements.

The hallmark of Rangers lies in their capacity to maintain a relentless barrage of damage, consistently chipping away at enemy forces. Their attacks carry immense power and accuracy, capable of whittling down foes with surgical precision.

These shrewd commanders excel at orchestrating the battlefield to their advantage. They can employ their talents to bolster and empower their comrades, transforming them into formidable forces.
