1. lifeless rock planet orbiting a distant star
2. discovered by an entity known as "The Creator" that saw potential and brought the elemental crystals—Aeroxyn (Air), Electrium (Electric), Pyronyte (Fire), Terrox (Ground), Cryonyte (Ice), Tidalyn (Water)—to this planet in order to develop an ecosystem that could potentially give rise to life
3. as time went by the elemental crystals began to interact with each other, starting vulcanic activity, shaping the land. Massive storms and rainfalls defined one massive ocean and a single continent named "Anarkya"
4. as the climate started to stabilize, The Creator powered the planet with Cosmical, Mystical, Biological, and Technological energies, in hopes of developing intelligent life. These energies are unable to interact with each other, meaning that the beings would be born with a single energy type (origin)
5. as intelligent beings started to emerge, civilizations based on the fundamental energies began to form.
6. The Creator observed the beings and their interactions, but as time went by, the civilizations started to clash, leading to a massive war between the four of them.
