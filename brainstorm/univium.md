- **Night:** As the sun sets, night casts its shadow, bringing coolness, mystery, and silence. The darkness veils the unknown, where malevolent forces often lurk, underscoring the ever-present threat of evil.

The balance between day and night is more than just a natural cycle, it reflects the universe’s fundamental duality. Together, they weave a tapestry of contrast and conflict, shaping the destinies of Univium’s inhabitants and the very essence of the universe itself.
