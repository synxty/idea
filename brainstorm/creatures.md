# Creatures

## Classes

### Wild

Creatures that have just emerged from the **Week of Genesis**, creatures that have not been picked to enroll in one of the **Houses of Mastery** or dropped by one, and even retired **Legends** or **Masters**. They roam freely across their respective regions and can be found and followed at any time.

### Prospects

Creatures in training within the **Houses of Mastery**. These creatures, selected during the mid-season event known as **Enrolment Day**, show exceptional potential and are undergoing rigorous development in preparation for the possibility of becoming **Legends** under the guidance of **Masters**.

### Legends

These are creatures that have reached an elite level of development and have been drafted by a team to participate in the **Synxty Championship**. They are the pride of their respective regions and have the opportunity to fight for the title of **Champion** and be eternally remembered in the history of **Synxty**.

### Masters

Creatures who have achieved the highest level of wisdom and expertise. They lecture in the **Houses of Mastery** and conduct research across regions to discover or create new **Abilities** and identify potential **Prospects**. **Masters** can be former **Legends**, former **Prospects** who never became **Legends**, or even **Wild** creatures whose wisdom and interest have led them to this class. They play a crucial role in mentoring and training new generations of **Legends** for the **Synxty Championship** and developing new **Abilities**.
