# Azuris

In the vast stillness of space, within the cradle of an uncharted solar system, there burned a lone star—**Azuris**. Unlike the cold void that surrounded it, **Azuris** was a beacon of light and warmth, a blue-white sun that shone with quiet brilliance. Its glow was steady, its radiance unwavering. It was not the violent, short-lived fire of a dying giant, nor the dim, aging ember of an ancient sun. **Azuris** was balanced—a celestial guardian, cradling its planets in gentle, nurturing energy. Among them was **Univium**, a world of unrealized promise.
