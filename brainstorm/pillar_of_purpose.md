# Pillar of Purpose

But at the center of **Anarkya** stood a fifth pillar, mysterious and unlike the rest. Colossal and the tallest of them all. Its origin and purpose were unknown, and it carried neither **Elemental** nor **Fundamental Energy**. Carved upon its ancient stone are profound words, believed by many to have been spoken by **The Creator** Himself:

> A world of water will only churn tides forever. A world of fire will only burn until nothing remains. A world of air will only howl into the void. And even when all exist together, they only shape the land — they do not shape the future. Only through true **syn**ergy and uni**ty** can purpose be found.

Its message has inspired countless interpretations, and many believe that the pillar’s mystery itself is a guiding force—an invitation for every generation to seek their own meaning and destiny. If these words were indeed spoken by **The Creator**, then this pillar stands as the only known clue to His true intentions for **Univium**. Generations have come to know it as the **Pillar of Purpose**: a title born not from understanding, but from the belief that within its message lies the key to something greater.
