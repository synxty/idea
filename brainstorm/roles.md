# Roles

In Univium, a Character’s Role represents their natural inclination in battle and their approach to challenges. Each Role embodies unique qualities that shape a Character’s appearance, abilities, and overall presence. While a Character’s Origin, Type, and Soul define their essence, their Role further influences how they interact with the world and others around them.

## Assassin

Assassins are stealthy and agile, often displaying sleek, sharp features and a nimble build. Their abilities typically focus on speed, evasion, and dealing swift, critical damage to opponents. Assassins may possess an air of mystery and intensity, with dark or muted colors, sleek silhouettes, and shadowy motifs that reflect their focus on stealth and precision.

## Healer

Healers are characterized by a soothing presence and calming aura, often having gentle, nurturing features and a graceful demeanor. Their abilities center on restoring health, shielding allies, and providing buffs or cleansing negative effects. Visually, Healers may be adorned with elements like light, ethereal colors, soft fabrics, or symbols of healing and life, such as plants, water, or light motifs.

## Paladin

Paladins blend offense and defense, embodying resilience and strength. They are often depicted with powerful physiques, wearing armor or gear that symbolizes their role as both protectors and warriors. Paladin abilities focus on absorbing damage, defending allies, and delivering powerful counterattacks. They may appear in bold colors like silver, gold, or deep blue, with elements representing their dual purpose—such as shields, banners, or radiant light.

## Ranger

Rangers are keen observers and skilled marksmen, with an affinity for long-range combat and adaptability. Often characterized by a lean build and sharp, focused features, Rangers possess abilities that enhance their precision, mobility, and environmental awareness. Their appearance might incorporate elements of nature—such as leaves, feathers, or earth tones—reflecting their connection to the natural world and their reliance on agility and finesse.

## Strategist

Strategists are tactical masterminds, with an aura of intelligence and foresight. They are typically portrayed with thoughtful expressions, calculating eyes, and an appearance that suggests wisdom and insight. Their abilities focus on manipulating the battlefield, setting traps, controlling enemy movements, and enhancing the effectiveness of their team’s abilities. Strategists might wear garments that signify knowledge, such as robes, glasses, or emblems associated with strategy and intellect.

## Titan

Titans embody raw power and endurance, often characterized by imposing statures, broad builds, and formidable strength. Their abilities revolve around physical prowess, direct confrontation, and overwhelming force, often involving area-of-effect attacks and the ability to withstand significant damage. Titans may appear with rugged, heavy armor, earth-toned colors, or elements that evoke the force of nature or raw, unyielding strength.
