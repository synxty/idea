# Characters

## Classes

### Legends

Characters that have reached an elite level of development and have been drafted by a team to participate in the **Synxty Championship**. They are the pride of their respective regions and have the opportunity to fight for the title of **Champion** and be eternally remembered in the history of **Synxty**.

### Prospects

Characters in training within a **House of Mastery**. These characters show exceptional potential and are undergoing rigorous development in preparation for the possibility of becoming **Legends** and competing in the **Synxty Championship**.

### Masters

Characters who have achieved the highest level of wisdom and expertise. They are responsible for mentoring and training **Prospects** in the **Houses of Mastery** and conducting research across regions to develop new **Abilities** and identify potential **Prospects**. **Masters** can be former **Legends**, former **Prospects** who never became **Legends**, or even **Rogues** whose wisdom and interest have led them to this class.

### Rogues

These characters roam freely across their respective regions and can be found and followed at any time. They may not have been picked to enroll in one of the **Houses of Mastery** or were dropped by one, or they could be retired **Legends** or **Masters**.

## Journey

### Region Training

Following their emergence, characters remain in their regions, where they continue to grow and adapt to their environment. During this period, they strive to demonstrate exceptional potential in hopes of being noticed by a **Master** and potentially selected for a **House of Mastery** during **Enrolment Day** transitioning into **Prospects**. Characters who are not selected continue their journey as **Rogues** with the possibility of being selected in future seasons.

### Mastery Training

As **Prospects**, characters undergo rigorous training and development under the guidance of **Masters** at a **House of Mastery**. During this phase, they focus on mastering their **Role**, improving their **Attributes**, and learning standard **Abilities** to ensure they are ready for **Draft Day**.

### Competitive Career

After **Draft Day**, characters join a team and attain the status of **Legend**. In this phase, they compete in the **Synxty Championship**, working together with their teammates to secure victory, gain prestige, and fight for the title of **Champion**. This phase represents the peak of their journey, where they demonstrate their greatest strengths and achieve their most notable feats.

### Competitive Retirement

At this point, characters step back from active competition in the **Synxty Championship** but may continue to contribute to the community by becoming **Masters**, taking on mentorship roles, and focusing on research and developing new **Abilities** in the **Houses of Mastery**.

### Retirement

A phase where characters fully step back from their active roles. **Legends** who retire from competition and **Masters** who retire from the **Houses of Mastery** return to their regions and become **Rogues** once again.
