Whether you’re here to delve into the rich history of this world, discover its unique landscapes, or join in the excitement of the games, there’s something for everyone. Let the adventure begin!

## Lore

Eons ago, on the distant planet **Univium**, a relentless war raged across the sprawling continent of **Anarkya**. Forces of biological, mystical, technological, and cosmic energy clashed in an unending struggle for dominance, threatening to consume the entire planet. In a desperate bid to restore balance, **The Creator**, a powerful and enigmatic entity, intervened.

Drawing upon the universe’s core elements, **The Creator** fused six **Elemental Crystals** and unleashed a monumental blast at the heart of **Anarkya**. This cataclysmic event, known as **The Great Sundering**, shattered the crystals and fractured the continent into four new distinct regions. The warring forces were confined to these regions, and alongside the scattered fragments of the **Elemental Crystals**, unique environments and landscapes began to take shape.

At the epicenter of the devastation, a vast uncharted territory emerged, surrounded by the four regions. To prevent this central land from becoming a new source of conflict, **The Creator** established the **Anarkya Championship**, a grand tournament where creatures from each region would form teams and compete, showcasing their strength. This event fostered healthy rivalry and cooperation, transforming the central land into a hub of activity and camaraderie. This new region was later named **Synxty**, symbolizing unity and synergy.

As beings from the outer regions settled in **Synxty**, they built cities, towns, and communities, putting aside their differences to create a new era of collaboration and progress. **Synxty** flourished as a vibrant center of innovation and cultural exchange, where diverse beings coexisted and thrived.

Over time, **Synxty** evolved from a war-torn land into a beacon of unity and progress through **The Creator**’s intervention and the transformative power of competition and cooperation. As new allegiances and identities formed within its cities and communities, the original premise of the **Anarkya Championship** began to wane. The focus shifted from regional rivalries to vibrant competitions between cities and communities. This evolution led to the creation of the **Synxty League**, promising thrilling contests between cities that showcase the best strategies, teamwork, and individual skills.

## Regions of Univium

**Univium** is an expansive and diverse world, composed of five regions that collectively contribute to its overall harmony and vibrancy.

The prestigious **Synxty League** exemplifies this spirit, bringing together the region’s best teams to compete and achieve their highest potential. This dynamic environment makes **Synxty** a beacon of excellence and a testament to the potential of **Univium**.

### Bionyx: Univium’s Biome

Born from the isolation of biological energies unleashed by the cataclysmic explosion that fractured **Anarkya**, **Bionyx** is a lush and vibrant area teeming with life and natural beauty. It encompasses dense forests, expansive plains, vast oceans, and even volcanic and glacial areas, creating a dynamic environment rich in contrasts. The region features small settlements that blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings, promoting sustainability and harmony with nature. These communities serve as hubs for interaction and resource gathering, while the wilderness remains largely untouched, fostering a deep connection with the environment. This balance makes **Bionyx** a vital and cherished part of **Univium**, embodying the essence of life and nature.

### Cosmyn: Univium’s Cosmic Expanse

Cosmyn is an otherworldly region shaped by the cosmic forces that converged here in the wake of the great explosion that split **Anarkya** apart. Characterized by surreal landscapes and celestial phenomena, **Cosmyn** features floating islands, luminous crystal formations, asteroid fields, and vast starry skies that create a celestial ambiance.

### Mysteon: Univium’s Mystic Realm

Rooted in ancient mysticism and magic, **Mysteon** emerged as a realm where mystical energies converged following **The Great Sundering** and converged in this region. This enchanting realm is characterized by ancient forests, shimmering lakes, and mystical ruins, creating an atmosphere steeped in wonder and mystery. The landscape is dotted with ethereal phenomena such as floating orbs of light, enchanted flora, and ancient stone circles that pulse with magical energy. Interspersed with these serene settings are powerful thunderstorms, raging blizzards, and tempestuous ocean storms, reminiscent of mythical battles and godly conflicts, that sweep through the region, adding to its mystique. Small villages and hidden sanctuaries blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, serving as centers for mystical study and practice.

## Elemental Crystals

Forged by **The Creator** to balance **Univium**, the **Elemental Crystals** were powerful sources of energy that influenced the planet’s climate, weather, natural phenomena, and life forms. Recognizing their immense power, **The Creator** fused the crystals to unleash a concentrated blast, resulting in **The Great Sundering** that fractured **Anarkya** and reshaped the world. This cataclysm shattered the crystals into fragments, scattering them across the newly formed regions. Even in their fragmented state, these crystals retained their essence and power, merging with regional forces to shape unique landscapes. Today, these potent shards continue to influence the environments and inhabitants of the regions they occupy, making their presence a defining aspect of life in **Univium**. However, these crystal fragments are not evenly distributed. In each region, certain crystals are more predominant, their impact on the environment more pronounced, defining key aspects of the landscape, climate, and life forms. Other crystals, though present, exert a more subtle influence, contributing to the overall diversity without dominating the region’s character. This uneven distribution creates a rich tapestry of elemental energies across **Univium**, with each region reflecting a unique blend of crystal influences. An exception is **Synxty**, the core of the blast, where no crystal fragments settled after **The Great Sundering**. This absence of elemental influence makes **Synxty** a neutral ground, where the convergence of regional characteristics fosters innovation and unity.
