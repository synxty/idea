# Types

**Types** in **Univium** define the elemental energy from which a **Character** draws their power. Each **Type** is linked to one of the **Elemental Crystals**, representing a core element that influences a **Character**’s appearance, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as their interactions with the world around them.  The elemental energy of these crystals is fundamental to a **Character**’s identity, providing a dynamic layer to the ever-changing world of **Univium**.

## Air

**Air**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Aeroxyn** crystal, embodying the spirit of wind and flight. Known for their swiftness and agility, they have a light build, often with wings or other aerodynamic features that enhance their movement and control over air currents. Their movements are graceful and swift, and their appearance typically includes hues of white, light blue, and silver, reflecting their connection to the sky and shifting winds. These **Characters** thrive in open skies, atop mountain peaks, and across windy plains, where they can fully harness the power of **Aeroxyn**.

## Electric

**Electric**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Electrium** crystal, embodying the dynamic energy of electricity and lightning. Known for their speed and intensity, they often exhibit features that crackle with energy, such as glowing patterns, electric arcs, or conductive elements integrated into their bodies. Their appearance tends to include vivid hues of yellow, blue, and white, reflecting the colors of lightning bolts and electrical surges. These **Characters** excel in stormy environments, areas with high electromagnetic activity, and places charged with electricity, where they can fully tap into the power of **Electrium**.

## Fire

**Fire**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Pyronyte** crystal, embodying the fierce and consuming energy of flames and heat. Known for their strength and relentlessness, they often have features that evoke the essence of fire, such as glowing skin, flickering flames, or molten elements integrated into their form. Their appearance usually includes warm hues like red, orange, and gold, capturing the dynamic colors of fire and molten lava. These **Characters** thrive in volcanic landscapes, scorching deserts, and other areas with extreme heat, where they can fully unleash the power of **Pyronyte**.

## Ground

**Ground**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Terrox** crystal, embodying the solid and enduring strength of the earth. Known for their endurance and resilience, they often have features reminiscent of rock, soil, or metal, such as rugged skin, crystalline formations, or mineral-like armor. Their appearance typically includes earthy tones like brown, green, and gray, reflecting their deep connection to the land and its raw materials. These **Characters** excel in mountainous terrains, dense forests, and other grounded environments, where they can fully harness the power of **Terrox**.

## Ice

**Ice**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Cryonite** crystal, embodying the cold, still energy of ice, frost and snow. Known for their clarity and purity, they often have features that reflect the frozen expanses, such as icy skin, crystalline patterns, or frost-covered elements. Their appearance is typically adorned with cool shades like light blue, white, and light gray, mirroring the colors of glaciers, snow, and frozen lakes. These **Characters** thrive in arctic landscapes, frozen tundras, glacial fields, and other cold environments, where they can fully tap into the power of **Cryonite**.

## Water

**Water**-type **Characters** draw their power from the **Tidalyn** crystal, embodying the fluid, ever-changing energy of oceans, rivers, and rain. Known for their adaptability and flow, they often feature elements that evoke water’s dynamic nature, such as scales, fins, or aquatic motifs. Their appearance typically includes cool, flowing shades like deep blue, turquoise, and sea green, reflecting the vast and vibrant waters of **Univium**. These **Characters** thrive in aquatic environments, such as deep oceans, rushing rivers, and tranquil lakes, where they can fully channel the power of **Tidalyn**.
