# Classes

**Classes** represent the stages of a **Character**’s development. Each class plays a crucial part in **Univium** and the **Synxty League**. These classes reflect their development, responsibilities, and place within the broader narrative. Whether they are elite competitors, promising talents, wise mentors, or independent wanderers, each **Class** contributes uniquely to the rich tapestry of **Univium**’s story.

## Legends

**Legends** are characters who have achieved an elite level of development and have been drafted by a **Franchise** to compete in the **Synxty League**. Renowned for their exceptional skills, and strategic prowess, they are the pride of their regions, carrying the hopes and ambitions of their homeland as they strive for the title of **Champion** and the chance to be eternally remembered in the history of **Synxty**. With diverse backgrounds, appearances, and fighting styles, **Legends** are powerful forces on the battlefield, contributing to their team’s strategy with remarkable expertise. They captivate audiences, inspire future generations, and serve as enduring symbols of excellence and resilience across **Univium**.

## Prospects

**Prospects** are characters who have been selected to train in the specialized **Houses of Mastery**, recognized for their exceptional potential and innate talents. Under the guidance of experienced **Masters**, they undergo rigorous development to refine their attributes, learn new abilities, and fully embrace their destined **Role**. During this critical phase, **Prospects** face numerous challenges, from mastering the fundamentals of combat to developing advanced strategies and teamwork skills, all while honing the unique qualities that will define them as future **Legends**. Every step they take brings them closer to the ultimate goal of being drafted into a **Franchise** and competing in the **Synxty League**, where they can prove their worth and strive to become a **Champion**.

## Novices

**Novices** are newly spawned characters just beginning their journey in **Univium**. At this stage, they are full of untapped potential and natural talent but lack the training and refinement that comes with experience. **Novices** roam their home regions freely, learning about their innate attributes, and discovering their **Role** affinity. Closely observed by **Masters**, they strive to prove themselves worthy of being selected for a **House of Mastery** and advancing to become **Prospects**. As they embark on this initial phase, they begin to understand their deeper motivations and start shaping the direction of their growth.

## Rogues

**Rogues** can be found across their home **Region**, training, seeking new challenges, or simply enjoying their freedom after failing to reach the status of **Legend** or **Master**. Whether they were never selected to enroll in a **House of Mastery** or were dropped during their time as **Prospects**, many remain determined, continuing to develop their attributes in hopes of joining the **League** directly through a draft, securing a first or new opportunity in a **House of Mastery**, or becoming a **Master**.

## Masters

**Masters** have achieved the highest level of wisdom and expertise and have chosen to dedicate themselves to shaping the future of **Univium**. They are responsible for training **Prospects** in the **Houses of Mastery**, scouting **Novices** throughout the regions, and consulting for **Franchises** on strategy, team composition, and talent development. Beyond mentorship, **Masters** conduct research to discover and develop new abilities, drawing from their vast knowledge and experience. They can be former **Legends**, **Prospects** who never became **Legends**, or even **Rogues** whose wisdom and passion have led them to this path.

## Wanderers

**Wanderers** are former **Legends** or **Masters** who have retired and are now exploring the world. Distinguished by their past accomplishments and experience, **Wanderers** carry a reputation that grants them a certain level of respect and freedom, allowing them to move more easily across **Regions**. They are often on personal quests, adventures, or in search of new challenges, driven by motivations such as seeking knowledge, mentoring younger **Prospects**, or finding peace after a demanding career. Their journeys and choices continue to inspire others, and they occasionally play key roles in events that shape the future of **Univium**.
