# Houses of Mastery

The **Houses of Mastery** are prestigious institutions in the inner towns of **Synxty**, distanced from the competitive cities and border region influences. These expansive campuses serve as focused training grounds where **Prospects** undergo rigorous development to refine their innate traits and fully embrace their destined **Role**.

Each **House** specializes in one of these six distinct **Roles**, guiding **Prospects** through intense training, personalized mentorship, and role-specific challenges that cultivate their unique strengths. Under the guidance of experienced **Masters**, **Prospects** learn new abilities, harness their natural talents, and overcome their limitations, preparing them to become exceptional **Legends** who contribute strategically to their teams in battle.

Beyond training, the **Houses of Mastery** also serve as centers of innovation, where **Masters** undertake expeditions to other **Regions** to discover and refine new abilities that can be learned by **Legends**. While some of these abilities are created through direct field research and exploration, others are developed in-house by **Masters** drawing on their deep knowledge, ancient texts, and the teachings passed down through generations. This blend of traditional knowledge and new discoveries ensures that **Legends** are equipped with a diverse range of abilities to engage in battle with strength and versatility.

The **Houses of Mastery** are foundational pillars of the **Synxty League**, shaping the next generation of **Legends** and advancing the strategic evolution of battles. Through a blend of rigorous training, **Role** specialization, and ongoing innovation, they ensure every **Legend** is prepared to face fierce competitions and relentless challenges in their quest to become a **Champion**.
