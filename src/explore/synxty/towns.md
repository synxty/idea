# Towns

Complementing the bustling cities, the towns of **Synxty** enrich the continent’s dynamic landscape by offering distinct environments for growth, training, and rejuvenation. With sparser populations, expansive terrains, and untouched natural beauty, these towns provide serene, rustic settings that contrast with the vibrant activity of the urban centers.

As the **Synxty League** approaches, these towns are also experiencing transformations. Residents are banding together to enhance their facilities and prepare for the influx of visitors and competitors while maintaining the tranquil charm that makes them unique.

## Border Towns

Situated along **Synxty**’s periphery, the border towns are profoundly influenced by their proximity to neighboring continents. From the dense forests and rolling plains of **Bionyx** to the mystical mists of **Mysteon**, the celestial skies of **Cosmyn**, and the technological advancements of **Techyon**, each border town presents a unique blend of landscapes, climates, and cultures. This fusion creates distinct identities that bridge **Synxty** and its neighboring continents.

Within these border towns, as preparations for the **Synxty League** intensify, **Specialized Training Hubs** have been established to tap into the unique **Primal Forces** of the adjacent lands, providing **Legends** with tailored environments to refine their skills. These hubs utilize the distinct features and conditions of the surrounding areas, making them ideal for **Legends** to enhance their core strengths, attributes, and overall performance in alignment with their **Origin**. Additionally, these towns host **Cross-Continental Training Programs**, where **Legends** from other **Origins** can build resistance or improve their effectiveness in combat.

## Inner Towns

Deeper within **Synxty**, away from the direct influences of the bordering continents, the inner towns serve as tranquil havens offering a calm and focused environment. Known for their peaceful atmosphere and leisurely pace of life, these towns are ideal settings for introspection, recovery, and personal growth. With cobblestone streets, quaint inns, and lush gardens, they provide a serene contrast to **Synxty**’s bustling cities. Popular among travelers and **Wanderers**, these towns offer a much-needed respite during their journeys across **Univium**.

As the **Synxty League** approaches, these inner towns are also becoming sanctuaries for **Legends** to prepare themselves thoroughly. They serve as ideal places to heal injuries, regain strength, and receive holistic treatments that enhance physical conditioning and overall well-being. Beyond physical rejuvenation, the towns offer a space for **Legends** to reconnect with their purpose, rebuild confidence, find inspiration, and reignite motivation. The blend of natural beauty, quiet reflection, and supportive communities fosters an environment where **Legends** can return stronger and more focused, ready to face their next challenges in the competition.
