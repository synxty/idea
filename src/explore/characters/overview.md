# Characters

**Characters** are the driving force of **Univium**, propelling its narrative forward and encapsulating the very essence of the world. Each character is a distinct entity, molded by their **Origin**—the region from which they hail, by their **Type**—from the elemental crystal they draw their power, and by their **Soul**—their inner nature. These characters are more than mere participants in the unfolding story of **Univium**; they are its heartbeat, its voice, and its soul, each one contributing to the rich and diverse tapestry that makes up this extraordinary world.
