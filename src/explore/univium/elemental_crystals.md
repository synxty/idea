# Elemental Crystals

The **Elemental Crystals** are extraordinary sources of elemental energy that profoundly influence **Univium**’s climate, weather, natural phenomena, and life forms. Even in their fragmented state after **The Great Sundering**, these crystals retain their essence and power. However, as a result of said event, the fragments were not distributed evenly across the continents. In each continent, certain crystals are more predominant, their effects on the environment more pronounced. Others, while present, exert a more subtle influence, contributing to the overall diversity without overshadowing the continent’s character. This uneven distribution creates a rich tapestry of elemental energies across Univium, with each continent reflecting a unique blend of influences that shape both the environment and the cultures of its inhabitants.

## Aeroxyn

Embodying wind, sky, and the breath of life, ****Aeroxyn**** is the crystal of **Air**. It shapes the currents that sweep across **Univium**, influencing weather patterns, guiding winds, and affecting atmospheric conditions wherever its fragments rest. Associated with swiftness, freedom, and unseen forces, **Aeroxyn** is most prominent in **Bionyx** and **Cosmyn**, yet its touch is felt everywhere.

In regions with vast open skies, sweeping plains, and towering cliffs, the presence of **Aeroxyn** is unmistakable. Winds are constant companions, and floating islands drift through the air, buoyed by invisible currents. The weather is dynamic—frequent gusts, sudden shifts in pressure, and swirling clouds create a sense of perpetual motion and freedom, where the very air pulses with life.

## Electrium

As the crystal of **Electricity**, **Electrium** embodies lightning’s raw power, energy, and the life spark coursing through **Univium**. It generates intense electrical currents, shaping storms and illuminating landscapes where its fragments lie. Linked to intensity, speed, and the vibrant pulse of life in organic and technological systems, **Electrium** is most prevalent in **Mysteon** and **Techyon**, but its energy resonates globally.

Landscapes under **Electrium**’s influence crackle with energy. Towering storm clouds unleash powerful lightning that illuminates the skies. The air is charged with static electricity, and the ground hums, especially near metallic deposits. These regions are known for volatile weather—frequent thunderstorms, electromagnetic anomalies, and auroras light up the night with brilliant colors.

## Pyronyte

**Pyronyte**, the crystal of **Fire**, embodies flames’ fierce power, heat, and transformative energy that ignites life across **Univium**. It generates intense heat and light, governing volcanic activity, heatwaves, and wildfires in the landscapes it touches. Associated with strength, transformation, and relentless evolution, **Pyronyte** dominates in **Cosmyn** and **Mysteon**, with its fiery impact felt in other continents as well.

In areas where **Pyronyte**‘s fragments settle, intense heat and volcanic activity shape the environment. The crystal’s energy forms volcanic mountains that glow with molten lava flowing through deep earth fissures. Extreme temperatures prevail, with blistering days and fiery nights. The rugged, scorched terrains challenge even the most resilient, and periodic eruptions and geysers keep the landscape in constant flux.

## Terrox

Representing the solid foundation and nurturing essence that supports life, **Terrox** is the crystal of **Ground**. It shapes the land itself—governing geological processes, forming mountains and valleys, and enriching the soil. Linked to endurance, resilience, and stability, reflecting earth’s unyielding power, **Terrox** is most prominent in **Bionyx** and **Techyon**, yet its grounding force is universal.

Where **Terrox** exerts its presence, terrains are defined by rugged landscapes and formidable structures. The crystal’s energy raises towering mountains, spreads vast plains, and forms deep valleys, with mineral-rich grounds and fertile soils supporting robust ecosystems. The land feels alive with age-old weight, seismic activity and tectonic shifts, gradually but powerfully reshaping the terrain. Earthquakes and landslides are common, subtly altering the land.

## Cryonyte

Embodying cold, stillness, and the beauty of frozen landscapes, **Cryonyte** is the crystal of **Ice**. It brings frigid temperatures, sculpting glaciers, ice formations, and snow-covered terrains where its shards settle. Associated with clarity, purity, and the delicate balance between beauty and harshness, **Cryonyte** is most prevalent in **Cosmyn** and **Techyon**, but its chill extends also to other continents.

Where **Cryonyte** is present, it creates regions dominated by extreme cold. The crystal’s influence carves vast glaciers through the land, shaping valleys and fjords. Endless snow-covered plains emerge, reflecting pale sunlight, and towering icebergs drift in frigid seas. Crisp, biting winds carry the chill of perpetual winter. These lands often endure long, harsh winters with brief summers, remaining predominantly.

## Tidalyn

The crystal of **Water**, **Tidalyn** embodies fluidity, adaptability, and the life-giving essence flowing through **Univium**. It governs water’s movement—shaping rivers, lakes, oceans, and regulating tides and precipitation where its fragments reside. Linked to adaptability, flow, and constant movement sustaining the world, **Tidalyn** is most prominent in **Bionyx** and **Mysteon**, influencing all continents.

In landscapes where **Tidalyn**‘s fragments are found, rich water sources and aquatic ecosystems flourish. The crystal’s energy forms serene lakes, abundant rivers, and vast oceans, nourishing thriving flora and fauna. Waterfalls cascade down cliffs, creating misty rainbows, and the sound of flowing water fills the air, invoking tranquility and renewal. The weather in these regions is often characterized by frequent rainfall, lingering mists, and sudden storms, with torrential rains and powerful waves reshaping coastlines and floodplains.
