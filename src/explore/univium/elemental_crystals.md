# Elemental Crystals

Forged by **The Creator** to balance **Univium**, the **Elemental Crystals** were powerful sources of energy that influenced the planet’s climate, weather, natural phenomena, and life forms. Recognizing their immense power, **The Creator** fused the crystals to unleash a concentrated blast, resulting in **The Great Sundering** that fractured **Anarkya** and reshaped the world. This cataclysm shattered the crystals into fragments, scattering them across the newly formed regions. Even in their fragmented state, these crystals retained their essence and power, merging with regional forces to shape unique landscapes. Today, these potent shards continue to influence the environments and inhabitants of the regions they occupy, making their presence a defining aspect of life in **Univium**. However, these crystal fragments are not evenly distributed. In each region, certain crystals are more predominant, their impact on the environment more pronounced, defining key aspects of the landscape, climate, and life forms. Other crystals, though present, exert a more subtle influence, contributing to the overall diversity without dominating the region’s character. This uneven distribution creates a rich tapestry of elemental energies across **Univium**, with each region reflecting a unique blend of crystal influences. An exception is **Synxty**, the core of the blast, where no crystal fragments settled after **The Great Sundering**. This absence of elemental influence makes **Synxty** a neutral ground, where the convergence of regional characteristics fosters innovation and unity.
