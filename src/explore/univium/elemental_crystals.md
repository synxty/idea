# Elemental Crystals

The **Elemental Crystals** are extraordinary sources of elemental energy that profoundly influence **Univium**’s climate, weather, natural phenomena, and life forms. Even in their fragmented state after **The Great Sundering**, these crystals retain their essence and power. However, as a result of said event, the fragments were not distributed evenly across the continents. In each continent, certain crystals are more predominant, their effects on the environment more pronounced. Others, while present, exert a more subtle influence, contributing to the overall diversity without overshadowing the continent’s character. This uneven distribution creates a rich tapestry of elemental energies across Univium, with each continent reflecting a unique blend of influences that shape both the environment and the cultures of its inhabitants.

## Aeroxyn

**Aeroxyn** is the crystal of the element **Air**, embodying the essence of wind, sky, and the breath of life that flows through **Univium**. This crystal’s power influences the currents of air that sweep across the planet, shaping weather patterns, guiding the winds, and affecting the atmospheric conditions of the continents where its fragments have settled. The energy of **Aeroxyn** is associated with swiftness, freedom, and the unseen forces that steer the world from above.

While **Aeroxyn** is most predominant in the continents of **Bionyx** and **Cosmyn**, its influence can be felt across the other continents as well. It is most evident in landscapes characterized by vast open skies, sweeping plains, and towering cliffs, where the wind is a constant companion. Floating islands drift lazily through the air, buoyed by unseen currents, while the weather remains dynamic, marked by frequent gusts, sudden shifts in atmospheric pressure, and swirling clouds. These lands evoke a sense of perpetual motion and freedom, where the air itself seems to pulse with life.

## Electrium

**Electrium** is the crystal of the element **Electricity**, embodying the raw power of lightning, energy, and the spark of life that courses through **Univium**. This crystal’s influence generates intense electrical currents that shape weather phenomena, create storms, and illuminate the landscapes where its fragments have settled. The energy of **Electrium** is associated with intensity, speed, and the vibrant pulse of life that surges through both organic and technological systems.

While **Electrium** is most predominant in the continents of **Mysteon** and **Techyon**, its influence can be felt across the other continents as well. It is particularly apparent in landscapes that crackle with energy. Towering storm clouds frequently gather, unleashing powerful lightning strikes that illuminate the skies. The air is often charged with static electricity, and the ground hums with energy, especially near metallic deposits and mineral-rich areas. These lands are renowned for their volatile weather patterns, featuring frequent thunderstorms, electromagnetic anomalies, and auroras that light up the night sky with brilliant displays of color.

## Pyronyte

**Pyronyte** is the crystal of the element **Fire**, embodying the fierce, consuming power of flames, heat, and the transformative energy that ignites life across **Univium**. This crystal’s influence generates intense heat and light, governing volcanic activity, guiding heatwaves and wildfires, and illuminating the landscapes where its fragments have settled. The energy of **Pyronyte** is associated with strength, transformation, and the relentless drive to overcome obstacles and evolve.

While **Pyronyte** is most predominant in the continents of **Cosmyn** and **Mysteon**, its influence can be felt across other continents as well. It is most evident in landscapes shaped by intense heat and fiery activity. Volcanic mountains tower over the land, their peaks glowing with molten lava that flows through deep fissures in the earth. These lands often experience extreme temperatures, with blistering heat during the day and a fiery glow illuminating the night sky. The ground is often scorched, with rugged, rocky terrains that challenge even the most resilient beings. Periodic eruptions and geysers of steam and lava are common, creating a landscape that is constantly in flux.

## Terrox

**Terrox** is the crystal of the element **Ground**, embodying the solid foundation, strength, and nurturing essence that supports life across **Univium**. This crystal’s influence shapes the very land itself, governing geological processes, creating mountains and valleys, and enriching the soil that sustains flora and fauna. The energy of **Terrox** is associated with endurance, resilience, and stability, reflecting the unyielding power of the earth.

While **Terrox** is most predominant in the continents of **Bionyx** and **Techyon**, its influence can be felt across every continent. It is particularly evident in landscapes defined by rugged terrain and formidable natural structures. Towering mountains, vast plains, and deep valleys mark these regions, where the ground is rich with minerals and the soil is fertile, supporting a robust ecosystem. The land here feels alive with the weight of ages, with seismic activity and tectonic shifts shaping the terrain in gradual yet powerful ways. Earthquakes, landslides, and the slow erosion of rock are common, constantly altering the landscape in subtle but profound manners.

## Cryonite

**Cryonite** is the crystal of the element **Ice**, embodying the essence of cold, stillness, and the beauty of frozen landscapes that grace **Univium**. This crystal’s influence brings forth frigid temperatures, sculpting glaciers, ice formations, and snow-covered terrains where its fragments have settled. The energy of **Cryonite** is associated with clarity, purity, preservation, and the delicate balance between beauty and harshness.

While **Cryonite** is most predominant in the continents of **Cosmyn** and **Techyon**, its influence can be felt across other continents as well. Its presence is most apparent in landscapes defined by extreme cold and the dominance of ice and snow. Vast glaciers carve their way through the land, their slow, inevitable movement shaping valleys and fjords. Snow-covered plains stretch endlessly, reflecting the pale light of distant suns, while towering icebergs drift in frigid seas. The air is crisp and clear, with biting winds that carry the chill of endless winters. These lands are often marked by long, harsh winters, brief summers, and a landscape that remains predominantly frozen.

## Tidalyn

**Tidalyn** is the crystal of the element **Water**, embodying the fluidity, adaptability, and life-giving essence that flows through **Univium**. This crystal governs the movement of water, shaping rivers, lakes, oceans, and regulating tides and precipitation in the landscapes where its fragments have settled. The energy of **Tidalyn** is associated with adaptability, flow, and the constant movement that sustains and shapes the world.

While **Tidalyn** is most predominant in the continents of **Bionyx** and **Mysteon**, its influence can be felt across all continents. Its presence is most evident in landscapes marked by abundant water sources and rich aquatic ecosystems, including serene lakes, flowing rivers, and vast oceans. These bodies of water provide sustenance to the flora and fauna that thrive in these environments. Waterfalls cascade down cliffs, creating misty rainbows, and the sound of flowing water fills the air, invoking a sense of tranquility and renewal. The weather in these lands is often characterized by frequent rainfall, mists that linger in the air, and the ever-present sound of water in motion. Storms can arise suddenly, bringing torrential rains and powerful waves that reshape coastlines and floodplains.
