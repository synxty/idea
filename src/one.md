## Univium

### Unveiling

**Univium** is a world of remarkable diversity, both in its landscapes and the beings that inhabit it. From lush forests to sprawling cities, every corner of this planet pulses with life and energy. But beneath the surface of its vibrant present lies a rich yet turbulent past—one shaped by epic events that have defined its continents and the beings who call it home today. To truly understand **Univium**, we must look back to the events that set the foundation for this extraordinary world.

#### The Age of Chaos

Eons ago, **Univium** was a world consumed by chaos. Its vast, singular and massive continent, **Anarkya**, was the stage for an endless war where the four **Primal Forces**—**Biological**, **Cosmical**, **Mystical**, and **Technological**—waged brutal and merciless battles for supremacy. Fighters from every force clashed without mercy, their relentless conflicts drenching the land in bloodshed, death, and ruin. The skies burned, the ground shook, and the oceans boiled as the very essence of the planet threatened to unravel. No place on **Anarkya** was spared from the fury, as each force sought total control, pushing the world itself to the brink of destruction.

#### The Great Sundering

Amidst the devastation, recognizing that the planet could not survive the escalating chaos, a powerful and mysterious entity known as **The Creator** intervened. In a desperate effort to restore balance to the crumbling world, **The Creator** fused six crystals, filled with elemental energy that had long shaped the planet’s climate, weather, natural phenomena, and life forms—the **Elemental Crystals**. This fusion unleashed an immense surge of energy, culminating in a catastrophic blast at the heart of **Anarkya**—an event that would come to be known as **The Great Sundering**. In a single, world-altering strike, the vast continent was shattered into five distinct continents. Four of these continents—**Bionyx**, **Cosmyn**, **Mysteon**, and **Techyon**—each confined one of the **Primal Forces**, while the fifth became the enormous crater left by the blast, a nameless barren wasteland devoid of life.

In the aftermath, countless lives were claimed, and the landscape of **Univium** was forever altered. The **Elemental Crystals**, once fused, did not resist the blast and fractured into fragments that scattered across the world, embedding themselves in the very fabric of the land. These fragments, imbued with the essence of their respective elements, would go on to shape the new continents of **Univium**, influencing the climate, terrain, and inhabitants in profound ways. In contrast, the central continent was completely destroyed, inhospitable to life. The ground was scorched black from the blast, toxic and barren. The air was thick with the remnants of chaos. The fragments of the crystals lay completely powerless—a haunting reminder of the conflict that had ravaged the land.

#### The Dawn of Synxty

As the ages passed, the once desolate crater blossomed into a thriving landscape, fueled by the scattered fragments of the **Elemental Crystals** that emerged from the ashes of the site. Nature’s resilience took hold as volcanic activity resumed, reshaping the land and giving rise to hills that radiated warmth. Lush forests flourished with exotic plants and vibrant flowers thriving in the rich soil, while vast plains stretched out, adorned with wild grasses and colorful blooms. Shimmering lakes mirrored the expansive sky, and rivers meandered through the terrain, with streams trickling alongside to nourish the burgeoning life. In cooler shaded areas, glistening glaciers towered majestically, their surfaces sparkling in the sunlight, while soft blankets of snow adorned the landscape. Thunderstorms rumbled overhead, refreshing the land with life-giving rain. The air, once heavy with chaos, became crisp and invigorating, alive with the sounds of rustling leaves and wildlife. This vibrant landscape stood as a testament to the remarkable power of the **Elemental Crystals**, which, alongside the relentless force of nature to heal and renew, helped transform this continent into a thriving cradle of life, no longer resembling a crater.

Observing the transformation of the central continent, now blooming with wildlife and vitality, **The Creator** realized that while the containment of the **Primal Forces** brought a measure of balance, the once inhospitable land could become a focal point for new conflicts over territorial dominance as it was encircled by the other four newly formed continents. Although many years had passed since **The Great Sundering**, the echoes of past conflicts still resonated, and ambitions to dominate the now habitable land could easily spark new hostilities. To safeguard the fragile peace, **The Creator** established this continent as a controlled battleground for the **Anarkya Championship**, a tournament created to honor the countless lives lost during the conflicts of the past and the legacy of the continent that once existed. In doing so, **The Creator** aimed to foster uni**ty** and respect among all inhabitants of **Univium** by channeling conflicts into a structured contest rather than chaos. This competition would bring together the strongest fighters from each continent to compete for the title of **Champion**, creating an atmosphere of anticipation and excitement.

Over time, the inhabitants of **Univium** began to put aside their differences and embrace the vibrant possibilities of the central continent. Formerly divided by the **Primal Forces**, these diverse beings began to coexist harmoniously and discovered that they had much more in common than they initially believed. This newfound **syn**ergy, fostered by the **Anarkya Championship**, brought peace and tranquility as everyone engaged in the tournament. Settling in this continent, former rivals became neighbors, working together in a spirit of uni**ty**, sharing their unique cultures, traditions, and knowledge. This collaboration transformed the area into a melting pot of ideas and innovations, forging new communities and developing bustling towns and cities. Nowadays, the inhabitants of this continent take pride in the values of **syn**ergy and uni**ty** that define it, which was aptly named **Synxty**.

#### New Era, New Challenges

Today, **Univium** stands as a testament to the power of balance, cooperation, and renewal. The scars of the past have healed, and the wounds of **The Great Sundering** have given way to new growth and vitality. The four continents **Bionyx**, **Cosmyn**, **Mysteon**, and **Techyon** showcase the essence of their respective **Primal Forces** through their unique landscapes, inhabitants, and cultures. As for **Synxty**, what was once a barren wasteland has emerged as the heart of **Univium**—a thriving hub of life and community where most of the planet’s activities and events take place, making it the capital of this exciting world.

With **Synxty** thriving, the rivalries between continents are starting to fade, and with them, the interest in the **Anarkya Championship**. Cities and communities are eager to be represented in a competition that reflects their unique identities and aspirations, seeking a more engaging and dynamic contest. In response to this call, a new league is about to be born—the **Synxty League**. This league will feature **Franchises** representing cities and communities, each managing teams of the most skilled fighters from all continents of **Univium**. These teams will compete in a series of challenging battles to prove their worth and claim the title of **Champion** of the world. The **Synxty League** is meant to be a celebration of diversity, **syn**ergy, and uni**ty**, as each **Franchise** strives for greatness in a showcase of strategy, teamwork, and individual skills.

The social fabric of **Synxty**’s cities is woven from the diverse backgrounds of its inhabitants.

### Towns

Towns in **Synxty** enrich the region’s dynamic landscape, offering distinct environments for growth, training, and recovery. With sparse populations, expansive terrains, and untouched natural beauty, these towns provide serene, rustic settings that stand in contrast to the vibrant activity of the cities.

#### Border Towns

Border towns in **Synxty** are located along the region’s periphery, where proximity to neighboring areas profoundly influences their character.
